### [Project page](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/hierarchical-3d-gaussians/) | [Paper](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/hierarchical-3d-gaussians/hierarchical-3d-gaussians_low.pdf) 

This repository contains the official authors' implementation associated with the paper "A Hierarchical 3D Gaussian Representation for Real-Time Rendering of Very Large Datasets". We explain the different steps required to run our algorithm. We use a ["toy example"](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/hierarchical-3d-gaussians/datasets/example_dataset.zip) of 1500 images organized in 2 chunks to illustrate each step of the method and facilitate reproduction. The full datasets presented in the paper will be released as soon as the data protection process is completed (please stay tuned).

## Roadmap
Please note that the code release is currently in alpha. We intend to provide fixes for issues that are experienced by users, due to difficulties with setups and/or environments that we did not test on. The below steps were successfully tested on Windows and Ubuntu 22. We appreciate the documentation of issues by users and will try to address them. Furthermore, there are several points that we will integrate in the coming weeks:
- Datasets: We will add links for large-scale datasets that are currently undergoing auditing.
- Windows binaries: Once we have sufficiently tested them, we will add pre-compiled binaries for the viewers on Windows.
- Direct conversion of legacy 3DGS models: we are testing the conversion of scenes trained with vanilla 3DGS to hierarchical models. Once the quality is assured and we have concluded testing, we will document the necessary steps to do so.
- Streaming from disk: currently, data is streamed on-demand to the GPU, however, the viewed dataset must fit into memory. This can become prohibitive in the hierarchy merger and real-time viewer. We will adapt the code to allow dynamic streaming from disk soon.
- Reduce real-time viewer resource usage: the storage configuration for the real-time viewer is unoptimized, and so is the speed. Users can define a VRAM budget for the scene, but it is not used as efficiently as it could be. We will iterate towards making sure that higher quality settings can be achieved with lower budgets and better framerates. We will try to make the budget so that it effectively limits the **total** application VRAM, including framebuffer structs.

```

## Running the method

Our method has two main stages: Reconstruction, that takes a (usually large) set of images as input and outputs a "merged hierarchy", and [Runtime](#3-real-time-viewer), that displays the full hierarchy in real-time. 

Reconstruction has two main steps: 1) **[Preprocessing](#1-preprocessing)** the input images and 2) **[Optimization](#2-optimization)**. We present these in detail next. For each step we have automatic scripts that perform all the required steps, and we also provide details about the individual components.

#### Dataset 
To get started, prepare a dataset or download and extract the [toy example](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/hierarchical-3d-gaussians/datasets/example_dataset.zip). 
The dataset should have sorted images in a folder per camera in `${DATASET_DIR}/inputs/images/` and optional masks (with `.png` extension) in `${DATASET_DIR}/inputs/masks/`. Masks will be multiplied to the input images and renderings before computing loss. 

You can also work from our full scenes. As we provide them calibrated and subdivided, you may skip to [Generate monocular depth maps](#13-generate-monocular-depth-maps). The datasets:
* [SmallCity](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/hierarchical-3d-gaussians/datasets/full_scenes/small_city.zip)


In the following, replace `${DATASET_DIR}` with the path to your dataset or set DATASET_DIR:
```
# Bash:
DATASET_DIR=<Path to your dataset>

# PowerShell:
${DATASET_DIR} = "<Path to your dataset>"
```

>*To skip the reconstruction and only display scenes, download pretrained hierarchies and scaffolds, place them under `${DATASET_DIR}/output/` and follow the [viewer instructions](#3-real-time-viewer). The pretrained hierarchies:* 
>* [*SmallCity*](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/hierarchical-3d-gaussians/datasets/results/small_city.zip) 

## 1. Preprocessing
As in [3dgs](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) we need calibrated cameras and a point cloud to train our hierarchies on.

### 1.1 Calibrating the cameras

The first step is to generate a "global colmap". The following command uses COLMAP's hierarchical mapper, rectify images and masks, and align and scale the sparse reconstruction to facilitate subdivision.
```
python preprocess/generate_colmap.py --project_dir ${DATASET_DIR}
```

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using calibrated images</span></summary>

If your dataset already has COLMAP (with 2D and 3D SfM points) and rectified images, they should be placed under `${DATASET_DIR}/camera_calibration/rectified`. As they still need alignment, run: 
```
python preprocess/auto_reorient.py --input_path ${DATASET_DIR}/camera_calibration/rectified/sparse --output_path ${DATASET_DIR}/camera_calibration/aligned/sparse/0
```

</details>
<br>

*This step takes ~ 47 minutes on our example dataset using a RTX A6000, more details on each steps of the script [here](#generating-colmap).*

### 1.2 Generate chunks
Once the "global colmap" generated, it should be split into chunks. We also run a per-chunk bundle adjustment as COLMAP's hierarchical mapper is faster but less accurate (if your global colmap is accurate, you can skip this time consuming step with `--skip_bundle_adjustment`). 

```
python preprocess/generate_chunks.py --project_dir ${DATASET_DIR}
```
*This step takes ~ 95 minutes on our example dataset using a RTX A6000, more details on each steps of the script [here](#generating-chunks).*
> note that by using `--use_slurm` you can refine the chunks in parallel, remember to set your [slurm parameters](#slurm-parameters) in `preprocess/prepare_chunks.slurm` (gpu, account, etc ...).

### 1.3 Generate monocular depth maps
In order to use depth regularization when training each chunks, depth maps must be generated for each rectified image. Then, depth scaling parameters needs to be computed as well, these two steps can be done using:
```
python preprocess/generate_depth.py --project_dir ${DATASET_DIR}
```
### Project structure
Now you should have the following file structure, it is required for the training part: 
```

project
└── camera_calibration
    ├── aligned
    │   └── sparse/0
    │       ├── images.bin
    │       ├── cameras.bin
    │       └── points3D.bin
    ├── chunks
    │   ├── 0_0
    │   └── 0_1
    │   .
    │   .
    │   .
    │   └── m_n
    │       ├── center.txt
    │       ├── extent.txt
    │       └── sparse/0
    │           ├── cameras.bin
    │           ├── images.bin
    │           ├── points3d.bin
    │           └── depth_params.json
    └── rectified
        ├── images
        ├── depths
        └── masks
```
## 2. Optimization

*The scene training process is divided into five steps; 1) we first train a global, coarse 3D Gaussian splatting scene ("the scaffold"), then 2) train each chunk independently in parallel, 3) build the hierarchy, 4) optimize the hierarchy in each chunk and finally 5) consolidate the chunks to create the final hierarchy*.

Make sure that you correctly [set up your environment](#setup) and [built the hierarchy merger/creator](#compiling-hierarchy-generator-and-merger)

The `full_train.py` script performs all these steps to train a hierarchy from a preprocessed scene. While training, the progress can be visualized with the original 3DGS remote viewer ([build instructions](#compiling-the-real-time-viewer)).
```
python scripts/full_train.py --project_dir ${DATASET_DIR}
```
<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments</span></summary>

### --colmap_dir
Input aligned colmap.

### --images_dir
Path to rectified images.

### --depths_dir
Path to rectified depths.

### --masks_dir
Path to rectified masks.

### --chunks_dir
Path to input chunks folder.

### --env_name
Name the conda env you created earlier.

### --output_dir
Path to output dir.

### --use_slurm

</details>
<br>

> note that by using `--use_slurm`, chunks will be trained in parallel, to exploit e.g. multi-GPU setups. To control the process, remember to set your [slurm parameters](#slurm-parameters) in `coarse_train.slurm`, `consolidate.slurm` and `train_chunk.slurm` (gpu, account, etc ...)

*This step takes ~ 171 minutes on our example dataset using a RTX A6000, more details on each steps of the script [here](#training-steps).*

# 3. Real-time viewer

The real-time viewer is based on SIBR, similar to original 3DGS. For setup, please see [here](#compiling-the-real-time-viewer)

## Running the viewer on a merged hierarchy
The hierarchical real-time viewer is used to vizualize our trained hierarchies. It has a `top view` that displays the structure from motion point could as well as the input calibrated cameras in green. The hierarchy chunks are also displayed in a wireframe mode.

![alt text](assets/hierarchy_viewer_0.gif "hierarchy viewer")

After [installing the viewers](#compiling-the-real-time-viewer), you may run the compiled SIBR_gaussianHierarchyViewer_app in `<SIBR install dir>/bin/`. Controls are described [here](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting?tab=readme-ov-file#navigation-in-sibr-viewers).

If not a lot of VRAM is available, add `--budget <Budget for the parameters in MB>` (by default set to 16000, assuming at least 16 GB of VRAM). Note that this only defines the budget for the SCENE representation. Rendering will require some additional VRAM (up to 1.5 GB) for framebuffer structs. Note that the real-time renderer assumes that CUDA/OpenGL Interop is available on your system (see the original 3DGS documentation for more details). 

The interface includes a field for ```tau (size limit)``` which defines the desired granularity setting. Note that ```tau = 0``` will try to render the complete dataset (all leaf nodes). If the granularity setting exceeds the available VRAM budget, instead of running out of memory, the viewer will auto-regulate and raise the granularity until the scene can fit inside the defined VRAM budget.
```
SIBR_viewers/install/bin/SIBR_gaussianHierarchyViewer_app --path ${DATASET_DIR}/camera_calibration/aligned --scaffold ${DATASET_DIR}/output/scaffold/point_cloud/iteration_30000 --model-path ${DATASET_DIR}/output/merged.hier --images-path ${DATASET_DIR}/camera_calibration/rectified/images
```

    colmap matches_importer --database_path <database.db> --match_list_path <matching.txt file path>
    ``` 
    [**Command Line Arguments**](https://colmap.github.io/cli)

- Launch the `hierarchical mapper` to create the scene colmap:
    > note that this step will take a lot more time than the previous steps, it took ~39 minutes on the example dataset.

- Cut the calibration under `project/camera_calibration/aligned` into chunks, each chunk has its own colmap:
    ```
    python preprocess/make_chunk.py --base_dir <project/aligned/sparse/0> --images_dir <project/rectified/images> --output_path <project/raw_chunks>

## Monocular depth maps
Make sure to have the [depth estimator weights](#weights-for-monocular-depth-estimation).
1. #### Generate depth maps (should run for each subfolder in `images/`)
    * Using Depth Anything V2 (prefered):
        ```
        cd submodules/Depth-Anything-V2
        python run.py --encoder vitl --pred-only --grayscale --img-path [path_to_input_images_dir] --outdir [path_to_output_depth_dir]
        ```
    * Using DPT: 
        ```
        cd submodules/DPT
        python run_monodepth.py -t dpt_large -i [path_to_input_images_dir] -o [path_to_output_depth_dir]
        ```

2. #### Generate `depth_params.json` file from the depth maps created on step *1.* 
      *this file will be used for the depth regularization for single chunk training. It needs to be generated for each chunk.* 
      ```bash
      cd ../../
      python preprocess/make_depth_scale.py --base_dir [path to colmap] --depths_dir [path to output depth dir]
      ```

## Training steps

Make sure that you correctly [set up repositories and environments](#setup)

- **Coarse optimization**<br>
   To allow consistent training of all chunks, we create a basic scaffold and skybox for all ensuing steps:
    ```
    python train_coarse.py -s <path to project/aligned> -i <../rectified/images> --skybox_num 100000 --position_lr_init 0.00016 --position_lr_final 0.0000016 --model_path <path to output scaffold>
    ```
    
- **Single chunk training**<br>
It is recommended to train using depth regularization to have better results, especially if your scene contains textureless surfaces such as roads. Make sure you [generated depth maps](#monocular-depth-maps)
    ```
    python -u train_single.py -s [project/chunks/chunk_name] --model_path [output/chunks/chunk_name] -i [project/rectified/images] -d [project/rectified/depths] --alpha_masks [project/rectified/masks] --scaffold_file [output/scaffold/point_cloud/iteration_30000] --skybox_locked --bounds_file [project/chunks/chunk_name]    
    ```

- **Per chunk hierarchy building**<br>
*Make sure you followed the [steps to generate the hierarchy creator executable file](#compiling-hierarchy-generator-and-merger)*.
Now we will generate a hierarchy in each chunk:
    ```
    # Linux: 
    submodules/gaussianhierarchy/build/GaussianHierarchyCreator [path to output chunk point_cloud.ply] [path to chunk colmap] [path to output chunk] [path to scaffold]

    # Windows:
    submodules/gaussianhierarchy/build/Release/GaussianHierarchyCreator.exe [path to output chunk point_cloud.ply] [path to chunk colmap] [path to output chunk] [path to scaffold]
    ```

- **Single chunk post-optimization**<br>
    ```
    python -u train_post.py -s [project/chunks/chunk_name] --model_path [output/chunks/chunk_name] --hierarchy [output/chunks/chunk_name/hierarchy_name.hier]  --iterations 15000 --feature_lr 0.0005 --opacity_lr 0.01 --scaling_lr 0.001 --save_iterations -1 -i [project/rectified/images] --alpha_masks [project/rectified/masks] --scaffold_file [output/scaffold/point_cloud/iteration_30000] --skybox_locked --bounds_file [project/chunks/chunk_name]    
    ```

- **Consolidation**
*Make sure you followed the [steps to generate the hierarchy merger executable file](#compiling-hierarchy-generator-and-merger)*.
Now we will consolidate and merge all the chunk hierarchies:
    ```
    # Linux:
    submodules/gaussianhierarchy/build/GaussianHierarchyMerger [path to output/trained_chunks] "0" [path to chunk colmap] [path to output merged.hier] [list of all the chunk names] 
    
    # Windows:
    submodules/gaussianhierarchy/build/Release/GaussianHierarchyMerger.exe [path to output/trained_chunks] "0" [path to chunk colmap] [path to output merged.hier] [list of all the chunk names] 
    ```

## Slurm parameters
The beginning of each `.slurm` script must have the following parameters:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --account=xyz@v100      # your slurm account (ex: xyz@v100)
#SBATCH --constraint=v100-32g   # the gpu you require (ex: v100-32g)
#SBATCH --ntasks=1              # number of process you require
#SBATCH --nodes=1               # number of nodes you require 
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1            # number of gpus you require
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10      # number of cpus per task you require
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00         # maximal allocation time
``` 
Note that the slurm scripts have not been thouroughly tested.

# Evaluations
We use a test.txt file that is read by the dataloader and splits into train/test sets when `--eval` is passed to the training scripts. This file should be present in `sparse/0/` for each chunk and for the aligned "global colmap" (if applicable).

### Single chunk
The single chunks we used for evaluation: 
* [SmallCity](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/hierarchical-3d-gaussians/datasets/standalone_chunks/small_city.zip) 

To run the evaluations on a chunk:
```
python train_single.py -s ${CHUNK_DIR} --model_path ${OUTPUT_DIR} -d depths --exposure_lr_init 0.0 --eval --skip_scale_big_gauss

# Windows: build/Release/GaussianHierarchyCreator 
submodules/gaussianhierarchy/build/GaussianHierarchyCreator ${OUTPUT_DIR}/point_cloud/iteration_30000/point_cloud.ply ${CHUNK_DIR}  ${OUTPUT_DIR} 

python train_post.py -s ${CHUNK_DIR} --model_path ${OUTPUT_DIR} --hierarchy ${OUTPUT_DIR}/hierarchy.hier --iterations 15000 --feature_lr 0.0005 --opacity_lr 0.01 --scaling_lr 0.001 --eval

python render_hierarchy.py -s ${CHUNK_DIR} --model_path ${OUTPUT_DIR} --hierarchy ${OUTPUT_DIR}/hierarchy.hier_opt --out_dir ${OUTPUT_DIR} --eval
```

### Large scenes
Ensure that the test.txt is present in all `sparse/0/` folders. `preprocess/copy_file_to_chunks.py` can help copying it to each chunk.
Then, the scene can be optimized with `eval`:
```
python scripts/full_train.py --project_dir ${DATASET_DIR} --extra_training_args '--exposure_lr_init 0.0 --eval'
```

The following renders the test set from the optimized hierarchy. Note that the current implementation loads the full hierarchy in GPU memory.
```
python render_hierarchy.py -s ${DATASET_DIR} --model_path ${DATASET_DIR}/output --hierarchy ${DATASET_DIR}/output/merged.hier --out_dir ${DATASET_DIR}/output/renders --eval --scaffold_file ${DATASET_DIR}/output/scaffold/point_cloud/iteration_30000
```

### Exposure optimization
We generally disable exposure optimization for evaluations. If you want to use it, you can optimize exposure on the left half of the test image and evaluate on their right half. To achieve this, remove `--exposure_lr_init 0.0` from the commands above and add `--train_test_exp` to all training scripts.
